KNOWN BUGS
==========

Bugs for JDiff1.0.5
-------------------

BUG Work with crimson XML parser?

Other Bugs
----------

BUG: Using classdoc to compare jar files suggests that the handling of
classes with no packages is not correct. Temporarily disabled.

BUG: Handling of @link tags in the first sentence of comments is not as 
general as it should be. See convertAtLinks() comments.

BUG: Handle @docroot doc tags in Javadoc1.4

MINOR BUG: @links to methods may not be expanded properly if we don't have the 
signature in the @link. This only happens once (at invoke) in J2SE1.2/1.3, 
and the link goes to the right page, just not the right named anchor. 
Pretty rare.

MINOR BUG: Possibly simply due to the method being at the end of the HTML page. createGenericUpdateEventBody method in BW seems to not have the correct named anchor ref: perhaps it's the spaces? The link still works, just doesn't go the named anchor.
<A NAME="com.vitria.jct.JctLib.createGenericUpdateEventBody_changed(com.vitria.fc.meta.DataInterfaceDef, java.lang.String, java.lang.Object[])"></A>
<A HREF="com.vitria.jct.JctLib.html#
         com.vitria.jct.JctLib.createGenericUpdateEventBody_changed(com.vitria.fc.meta.DataInterfaceDef, java.lang.String, java.lang.Object[])"

BUG: HTML Validator reports lots of tag nesting issues with <nobr>. Need to 
revalidate HTML files - use Tidy?

BUG: Fix validation of XML

BUG? org.omg.CORBA.AnySeqHelper is generated by javac or javadoc in J2SE1.2, 
so has no documentation at the Sun website. Same for J2SE1.4 with 
org.omg.CosNaming.BindingIteratorPOA.html

BUG Sometimes changed is not linked but documentation is noted as having changed
because the documentation was inherited from a superclass.

DESIGN
======

Short Term:
----------

Refactor code in Diff.java to avoid duplication

Check where the user comments file is being generated to

Should JDiff check for changes in @value values?

Support inherited exclusion in RootDocToXML.java

Unix scripts need chmod +x and dos2unix to work

Does Javadoc add "()" for links to methods with no arguments? It does 
now, but perhaps it did not with J2SE1.2 javadoc?

Long Term:
---------

Break out subclasses in DiffMyers.java for jar files?

Add support for differences for other languages - create base classes, 
generalize XML.

Avoid need for scripts with J2SE1.4 by calling Javadoc from within an 
executable jar file.

The comment data in the deprecated attribute should really be in a CDATA 
section to avoid having to hide the HTML tags. But his would mean that the 
attribute deprecated would become an element and be harder to parse 
the text out.

Add ability to specify the location of the generated XML file?

Add a "jdiff_" prefix to all generated HTML files to clearly distinguish them
from Javadoc generated files?

Good to add support for Notes - force altered classes etc recorded in user_comments.xml to appear

Break HTMLReportGenerator up into two files

Should have added new class to ClassDiff etc? Tidy up where possible.

Constructor params should be elements?

Define accessor methods for _ vars

Use a modifiers field instead of separate modifiers in XML to save space?

Could do more checking for changed constructors in the first pass - check for the same type.

Add a name_ field to the ConstructorAPI class? Or a common superclass?

The final comparison call to Javadoc could be a separate Java program, but it 
seems more obvious to use Javadoc there too. Also provides the future ability 
to scan the current product at the same time as comparing it, reducing three 
steps to two.

The index files are quite large with J2SE14 - 1.7MB for an HTML file.

TESTS
=====

Check excludeTag with "@docset Internal" works, or however the tag value is 
defined in J2SE1.4
Test change from a class to an interface
Test interfaces more
Test very long names
Test changes in deprecation at a class level
Test @first
Test @link with all different formats
Test comments, multiple ids and the warning of multiple identical ids
Test that identifiers with spaces work
Test classes with no packages
Check that the comments file tests correctly for the correct APIs
Test case of a package and a class having the same name
Test case of moving a method into a superclass and vice versa
Test nested class definitions more closely

DOCUMENTATION, BUILD AND EXAMPLES
=================================

Examples:
---------

Add more changes

Documentation:
-------------

Write makefiles and ANT files?

Example of writing your own comments for the report

Developers' notes: TODO is must, OPTION is maybe

Tracking changes in where an inherited method is implemented
Can this be caught be checking parents during mergechange? Perhaps, but 
MethodAPI does not have references to the class it belongs to, nor do classes 
have references to their parents, just the name of the superclass or 
interface. Just doc it.

 I notice this under All Differences:
 
  <strike>addCellEditorListener</strike>(CellEditorListener) 
javax.swing.DefaultCellEditor
  
 This was quite confusing to me.  First, there's no link, so it
 appears to me that this method was removed, which I thought odd.  
 When I look deeper at it, the method was actually *moved* to 
 and now inherits from AbstractCellEditor, so it's a bit 
 literal to say it's been removed, though I understand why.
 Now, I believe TopBlend is not smart enough to make this 
 distinction either, but if you were able to add a "moved"
 category, you'd be doing a great service.  If that's not coming, 
 Help should clearly document this so people can interpret the
 results clearly.
 
REPORT PRESENTATION
===================

Better text demo of showing all private changes in APIs

Fix the small size of old and new links

Add ability to have no newjavadoc links either

Better presentation of all the documentation changes - sorted?

Run HTML checker on all generated HTML files

Avoid single letter indexes with just one entry on a new line
If a return type has a [] in it, browser may break the line before the []
Maybe the table should be name and a row under it for the description , to stop cramped names and descriptions?

black.gif is only needed if -stats is used
