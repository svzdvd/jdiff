JDiff 1.0.7

Known limitations, features and bugs which aren't likely to get fixed
soon. The number which follows is the SourceForge bug id.

1) HTML comments are also included in the diff between
documentation. (510309).
2) JDiff doesn't expand @docroot doc tags in Javadoc1.4
3) JDiff does not support locales other than English (530063).
4) Handling of @link tags in the first sentence of comments is not as 
general as it should be. See convertAtLinks() comments.
5) There is no -d option to redirect the generated XML output, or to
indicate where to read the API XML files in from. This was a
deliberate simplification, but is inconvenient on OS's which do not
support soft links.
6) strictfp and strict modifiers are not checked for between
APIs (547422).
7) An ANT task specifically for JDiff, as opposed to using the ANT
core Javadoc task (521353).
