<H1>JDiff - An HTML Report of API Differences</H1><br>
</center>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>JDiff</b> is a JavaDoc <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/javadoc/overview.html">doclet</a> which generates an HTML report of all the packages, classes,
constructors, methods, and fields which have been
removed, added or changed in any way when two APIs are compared. This
is very useful for describing exactly what has changed between two
releases of a product. Only the API (Application Programming
Interface) of each version is compared. It does not compare what the
source code does when executed, nor the JavaDoc-generated
documentation pages.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's great for reporting what has changed between two releases of your
product!

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a <a href="examples/README.html">complete example</a> of how
to use JDiff in the <code>examples</code> directory.
There is also an example of the results of using JDiff to 
<a href="http://javadiff.sourceforge.net/jdiff/jdkchanges/changes.html">compare the public 
APIs of JDK1.2 and JDK1.3</a>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The basic sequence of operations is to run JDiff on one set of source
files to create an XML file which represents the API for that version
of a product. Then JDiff is run again on another set of source
files to create an XML file which represents the API for the next version
of a product. Finally, JDiff compares the two APIs as represented in the
XML files and generates an HTML report which describes the differences
between the two APIs, together with comments describing the reasons
for the differences.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The results are written into a file called <code>changes.html</code>, with more files in a directory called <code>changes</code>.
 These files contain links to existing JavaDoc documentation. A CSS stylesheet is
 also generated in the file <code>stylesheet-jdiff.css</code>. <i>These are the
 only 
 files which need to be shipped with a product to include a report
 of what has changed since the previous release.</i>.

   Define the name which will be associated
   with the specified API. If the name which is given here has space 
   characters, they will be 
   replaced by underscore characters. This name with no spaces is used as the name of the XML

   E.g. "SuperProduct 1.0" generates an XML file named

  <DD STYLE="margin-right: 2cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
   The location of existing JavaDoc files
   for the new API, e.g. "http://java.sun.com/j2se/<b>1.3</b>/docs/api/" for the
   public documentation for JDK1.3. The default value is "../", which implies
   that the documentation directory generated by Javadoc is at the same level as
   the "changes.html" file generated by JDiff. Slashes are always
   forward in the argument, since this is an HTML link. The argument
   should also always end in a forward slash. If a relative value is

      for the public documentation for JDK1.3. The default value is null, which 
      results in no links to JavaDoc-generated documentation for the previous 
      release. Slashes are always forward in the argument, since this is an HTML

   This can be set to "all", "remove", "add",

   If it is set to "change", then

   from comments which it uses. 
   This should only really be necessary if the first line of a
   comment has used explicit Unicode character escape sequences which
   cannot be printed, or more importantly for JDiff, read in from XML.
   If this option is used, JDiff may fail to read in an XML
   file, and exit with an error message about "an invalid XML character (Unicode:
   0x....)" on a certain line in the file. Turning off this option does
   make creating large XML files a little faster.

  <code>-excludetag <<i>exclude tag</i>></code></DT> 
  <DD STYLE="margin-right: 2cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
   The argument passed in with this causes
   JDiff to ignore program elements (packages, classes, constructors,

   e.g. "@exclude", "@docset Internal".

<H2><A NAME="notes"></A>NOTES</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<ul>
<li>Interfaces appear in <i>italics</i>, just as in JavaDoc documentation.</li>
<li>When a package or class appears in <b>bold</b>, it has been added in
the new version or API.</li>
<li>When a package or class appears <strike>struck through</strike>, it has been removed in
the new version or API.</li>
<li>When a constructor is added, two entries are added to the "All
Differences" index: one for the addition of a new constructor, and
one for the change of the class. The constructor entry has
"constructor" after it.</li>
<li>There are some complex changes which can occur between versions, for example, when two or more methods with the same name change simultaneously, or when a method or field is moved into or from a superclass. 
In these cases, the change will be seen as a removal and an addition, rather than as a change. Unexpected removals or additions are often part of one of these type of changes.</li>
<li>It is quite often useful to change the memory parameters for
JavaDoc, e.g. pass in <code>-J-Xmx128m</code> to JavaDoc.</li>
<li>On a P3 450MHz machine, to scan all of the JDK <code>Java</code> 
and <code>javax</code> packages and generate XML takes about 2 minutes
per version. To generate a report from the XML files takes about 30s</li>
<li>The <code>api.xsd</code> template describes the format of the XML
for the APIs, and the <code>comments.xsd</code> template describes the format
of the XML for the comments. The API template is independent of any
related work at Sun, but the intention is to adopt whatever becomes
the <i>de facto</i> standard in the future, whilst retaining backward
compatibility.</li>
<li>Comments in the comments XML file do get reordered during
regeneration. This is harmless.</li>
</ul>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<hr>

<H2><A NAME="addingcomments"></A>ADDING COMMENTS TO A REPORT</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Comments can be added to a report by using a text editor to add text
to the "user_comments_X_to_Y.xml" file, where "X" and "Y" are the
names of the two APIs being compared. This file is automatically regenerated
each time the report is generated. Comments which become unused are
moved to the end of the file and placed inside XML comments. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE> The text which is added can be HTML text if necessary, but if the 
  HTML is incorrect, JDiff may fail to read the comments file and exit. Note that 
  because this HTML is stored in an XML document, single tags are not permitted. 
  For example, most browsers permit HTML which looks like "&lt;p>Here is some 
  text.", with no closing tag. XML requires that either a closing tag exists ("&lt;/p>"), 
  or that the single tag is closed, e.g. "&lt;p/>Here is some text.". </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To write comments for a particular removal, addition or change in the
JDiff-generated report, edit the comments XML file. Your changes will
be automatically incorporated into a new version of this file when the
report is next generated. Search the file for the identifier for the
particular removal, addition or change, using the package name, class
name and member name to find the identifier. Alternatively, look at
the HTML source of a report and note the identifier near the intended
place for the comment. Add the desired text between the &lt;text>
elements. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sometimes you may want to have the same comment text appear in
multiple places in the report. You can do this by having multiple
&lt;identifier> elements in a single &lt;comment> element. This
grouping does not persist after the comments file is regenerated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The first sentence from a comment in the source code for an element is
available in the comments XML file by using the @first tag. This tag
will be replaced (once) in the comments in the report by the first
sentence from the appropriate JavaDoc comment.

During the generation of a report, JDiff also reports a percentage

10% difference between the APIs". This statistic is calculated in the
following way:

Percentage change = 100 * (added + removed + 2*changed)

                    sum of public elements in BOTH APIs
</pre> 

So if there are 15 packages in the old API, and 2 of these are removed,
and 17 packages in the new API, 1 of which is newly added, and only 3
of which have changed, then the simple percentage difference would be:

<pre>
100 * (1 + 2 + 2*3)/ (15 + 17) = 28%
</pre>

A change of 100% means that there are no packages in common between
the two APIs. A change of 0% indicates that nothing changed between
the two APIs. This formula is applied recursively in JDiff for classes
and their members. That is, the value for the number of packages
changed is not an integer, but instead is the value obtained by
applying the same formula to the all the classes in the changed
packages, and then to all the members of the changed classes.
 This results in a lower, but more accurate, percentage difference.
The percentage difference value does not appear anywhere in the HTML
report files generated by JDiff.
The test suite for JDiff v1.0 had a difference value of approximately 63%. 
A real-world value is the value for the differences between JDK1.2 and
JDK1.3, which is approximately 8%.

<li>JDiff does not tell you how two web pages differ. Nor does it
compare the contents of JavaDoc web pages. So if you change the text
in comments
between versions, don't expect to see the changes appear in JDiff output.</li>
<li>If JDiff could tell you what had changed about the way two
versions of an API execute, the <a
