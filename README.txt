The JDiff doclet is used to generate a report describing the
difference between two public Java APIs. For more information on
the doclet and instructions for using it, see:

examples/README.html

./jdiff.html contains the reference page for JDiff. 

An example of using JDiff to compare the public APIs of JDK1.2 and
JDK1.3 can be seen at: 

http://javadiff.sourceforge.net/jdiff/jdkchanges/changes.html

or via http://www.pobox.com/~doar and the SourceForge javadiff project
