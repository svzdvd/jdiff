<H1>Building and Running JDiff</H1>
</center>

<p>
JDiff comes with a set of Windows batch files to compile JDiff and run
the unit tests,
These are in the directory "build". 
Make sure you are in the <code>build</code> directory and have set the
environment variable <code>JAVA_HOME</code> to the root of your
current J2SE (JDK) installation.
and then execute one of the following scripts. Do inspect the output
carefully for failures, since batch files do not stop at failure, by default.

<ul>
<li>To build JDiff from source, type: <code>.\makejdiff</code></li>

<li>To build JDiff tests from source, type: <code>.\maketests</code></li>

<li>To run JDiff tests, type: <code>.\runtests</code><br>
Note that a warning about "a method no longer being deprecated" is an
expected part of the output when running this batch file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following scripts assume you have source code for each J2SE (JDK)
locally and have edited the scripts to indicate where the source code
is located.

<ul>
<li>To create XML for the J2SE1.2 API, type: <code>.\jdk12toXML</code></li>

<li>To create XML for the J2SE1.3 API, type: <code>.\jdk13toXML</code></li>

<li>To generate a report showing the differences between the two J2SE
versions, type: <code>.\diffJDK</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Running <code>prepare_release</code> will clean all the directories and
prepare the JAR file and ZIP file for shipping JDiff. Be warned that
it will remove all generated XML files.

<p>To compare two JAR files, see <code>jdiffjar</code> for an
example. This uses the <code>classdoc</code> Java application from 
<a href="http://www.jensgulden.de">Jens Gulden</a>, which generates a
RootDoc object for any doclet from a JAR file. It is also a good place
to see how RootDoc objects can be constructed for any language, not
just Java.
